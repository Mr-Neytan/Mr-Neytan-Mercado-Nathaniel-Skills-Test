# Mercado-Nathaniel-Skills-Test
Hello! This is my official submission for the IT Skills Test of the UP CAPES 23-24 Application Process. This repository is currently public, please let me know if I should make it private.

# Structure and Contents
This repository has 2 branches: main & master. The master branch is where I keep recent changes to my work before pushing to main. This helps in the reviewing proces in order to make sure I don't push "bad code" and can go back in case I make a mistake.

Inside this repository, you can find 4 folders: Basics, Frontend_Development, Backend_Development, and Automation. Let's go over what is in each of them.


## Basics
This folder contains a simple food website that uses plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It contains one homepage, 4 recipe pages, and one contact form page. There is also an assets folder that contains all the images used.

## Frontend_Development
This folder builds on the simple page built in the Basics folder. It is similar in folder structure. The difference is that the website in here uses Bootstrap CSS along with plain CSS to further enhance the design of the website.

## Backend_Development
Contained in this folder is a python file that mimics the CRS.

## Automation
Contained in this folder is a text file that connects to a spreadsheet that can send an email to students who are graduating.
